 <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_penalty_points"> Penaly Points </sc_element> </b> Mistakes made during the passage of the route are converted into penalty points. Most competitions are held according to the rules of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI) with the following penalties. The first disobedience or refusal = 3 penalty points, the second refusal = 6, the third refusal is followed by disqualification. One downed barrier or one or more legs in a ditch with water = 4 penalty points, falling = 8 points, exceeding the time limit = 0.25 points for every second over the norm. During the jump-off, every second over the time limit is punished with one penalty point. If the maximum time limit is exceeded, the rider and the horse are disqualified.
