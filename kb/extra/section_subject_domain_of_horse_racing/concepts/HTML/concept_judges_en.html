 <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_judges"> Judges </sc_element> </b> Competitions in competition with the composition of participants not exceeding 120 people are judged by three judges. If more than 120 GITs are presumed in one day, there should be four judges, and if the figure of 200 GITs is exceeded, the jury should consist of at least five judges. In the presence of a water barrier, an additional judge should be released. If the number of GITs does not exceed 50, two judges are enough.
