 <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_smooth_horse_racing"> Handicap </sc_element> </b> â€”  a competition in which they try to equalize the <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_horse"> horses </sc_element> </b> by means of an additional load. It is not so easy to pick up <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_horse"> horses </sc_element> </b> of the same level for a <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_horse_racing"> race </sc_element> </b>, and by hanging a small load on someone's saddle, they try to put the participants in equal conditions. Sometimes a betting race is singled out separately, where each participant makes a contribution in a certain amount, and the winner takes everything.
