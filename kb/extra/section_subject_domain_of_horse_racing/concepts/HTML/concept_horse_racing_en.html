 <b> <sc_element sys_idtf = "concept_horse_racing"> Horse racing </sc_element> </b> - is a part of equestrian sport, usually a competition involving two or more horses led by jockeys (or sometimes without riders), over a certain distance for competition. Horse racing is one of the most ancient sports, since its basic premise — to determine which of two or more horses is the fastest on a given course or distance — has remained unchanged since ancient times.
